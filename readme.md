# Espapy #

A simple data viewing and analysis tool for Espadons.


## Getting Started ##

Here are instructions for getting started with Espapy. These instructions will try to explain things from the very beginning. In the end you will be able to use Espapy.

First we will download something called `Anaconda`, which is a computer program that helps us run other computer programs (in this case we will use `Anaconda` to run `Espapy`). Second, we will download `Espapy`. Third, we will run `Espapy` for the first time.

### Step 1: Downloading Anaconda ###

To complete this step, you need at least 5 GB of space on your computer. Once you have checked that you have the required space, please go to this webpage - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual . There should be a download button on that webpage. Click the download button to download `Anaconda`. This download will take some time.


After the download finishes, double click the file you downloaded to finish setting up `Anaconda` on your computer. Double clicking the downloaded file will open a program that walks you through the setup process. You can leave the default options as they are and just keep clicking next. It should say when it is finished. After the setup finishes, you have completed this step.


### Step 2: Downloading Espapy ###

`Espapy` is a much smaller size than `Anaconda` at under 10 MB. To download it, click the green `â†“ Code` button at the top of this page. That should open up a menu where one of the options is `Download ZIP`. Click on `Download ZIP` and a compressed ZIP file that contains `Espapy` will download. After the download completes, extract the contents of the ZIP file to an accessible place on your computer. You have now downloaded `Espapy`.


### Step 3: Running Espapy ###

Will fill out this step tomorrow.
