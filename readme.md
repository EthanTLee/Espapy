# Espapy #

A simple data viewing and analysis tool for Espadons.


## Getting Started ##

Here are instructions for getting started with Espapy. These instructions will try to explain things from the very beginning. In the end you will be able to use Espapy.

First we will download something called `Anaconda`, which is a computer program that helps us run other computer programs (in this case we will use `Anaconda` to run `Espapy`). Second, we will download `Espapy`. Third, we will run `Espapy` for the first time.

### Step 1: Downloading Anaconda ###

To complete this step, you need at least 5 GB of space on your computer. Once you have checked that you have the required space, please go to this webpage - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual . There should be a download button on that webpage. Click the download button to download `Anaconda`. This download will take some time.


After the download finishes, double click the file you downloaded to finish setting up `Anaconda` on your computer. Double clicking the downloaded file will open a program that walks you through the setup process. You can leave the default options as they are and just keep clicking next. It should say when it is finished. After the setup finishes, you have completed this step.


### Step 2: Downloading Espapy ###

`Espapy` is a much smaller size than `Anaconda` at under 10 MB. To download it, click the green `â†“ Code` button at the top of this page. That should open up a menu where one of the options is `Download ZIP`. Click on `Download ZIP` and a compressed ZIP file that contains `Espapy` will download. It should be called `Espapy-master`. After the download completes, extract the contents of the ZIP file to an accessible place on your computer. You have now downloaded `Espapy`.


### Step 3: Running Espapy ###

The instructions for running `Espapy` on Windows and MacOS are a little different, so I will first give instructions for MacOS, then Windows. Linux users can follow the same instructions as MacOS users.

#### MacOS ####

In order to run Espapy, first open up the `Terminal` application. You can do this by using the `Spotlight Search` tool or by double clicking the `Terminal` application in your `Utilities` folder. The `Utilities` folder is located in the `Applications` folder. `Terminal` is an application that allows you to use your computer in a different way. Using `Terminal`, you can do things like move files, create folders, and run applications.  We will use it to run `Anaconda`, which in turn will run `Espapy`. 

After you open `Terminal`, the next thing to do is to navigate to the folder where you extracted `Espapy`. This is similar to navigating through folders using `Finder`. Let's see our current location by typing `pwd` into Terminal and pressing `enter`. You should see some line like `/Users/your_username` appear in the window. This is called a 'path' and represents a location within your computer.

Now that we know where we are, let's see what kinds of things we have in our current location. To do this type `ls` and press `enter`. You should see a list of files and folders appear.

Now let's try moving to one of these folders. For example, say that `ls` gave us the following:

```
Applications	Downloads	Music   
Desktop		Library		Pictures 
```

Let's also say that we extracted `Espapy` to our `Downloads` folder. In order to move to our `Downloads` folder, we type `cd Downloads` and hit `enter `. You should now be in the `Downloads` folder.

Now in order to run Espapy we have to move inside of the `Espapy-master` folder we extracted. Use the `cd Espapy-master` command to do this.

Last, let's run Espapy. Do this by running the `python espapy.py` command. This will run Espapy using Anaconda. You have finished this step if a new window with some buttons opens up.
